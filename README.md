Welcome!

This is the official website for the RADseq workshop following the XI Congreso Latinoamericano de Herpetologia in Quito, Ecuador, sponsored by <a href="http://zoologia.puce.edu.ec/Vertebrados/">QCAZ @ PUCE</a>.  <br>
The workshop will take place in room xx at PUCE (address) from July 31 until August 4. We will cover theory and experimental design of RADseq projects as well as laboratory methods and bioinformatic pipelines.      <br>
Please complete the following short courses on Bash BEFORE the workshop. <br>


Installation and Setup Instructions
==

If you are using a <b>Mac</b>, you will need to install a text editor. Some excellent options are either [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), or [Atom](https://atom.io/). Alternatively, you can download Apple's text editor, XCode, from the App Store. <br>
If you are using a <b>Windows/PC</b>, we recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)


So we are all working in the same computing environment, please follow these instructions:
1. Download and install [VirtualBox 5.1.24](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your operating system
2. Download the [virtual machine image](http://download.lab7.io/UT-BioComputing-RadSEQ.ova) with RADseq software.
3. Double-click on the .ova file to import it into the virtual machine.

Stacks, iPyrad, dDocent, R, cd-hit-est, fastx-toolkit, and fastqc are all installed in $HOME/Applications/BioBuilds and should be accessible via $PATH. AftrRAD is installed in $HOME/Applications/AftrRADv5.0. 
The login user and password are "user1" and "password", respectively.
